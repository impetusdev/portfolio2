            <section>Iâ€™m a Sydney based software developer, with a background in mechanical engineering, marketing, finance and customer service. I am currently undertaking the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive.</section>
            <section>From my time in leadership & financial modeling within the UTS Motorsports Electric team and a small startup, I found a love for abstract problem solving and communicating ideas vertically and horizontally to stakeholders. This ultimately led me to study software engineering in my spare time and then to the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive where I have been deepening my understanding of computation and web development. I am immensely motivated not only by the beauty of the craft but also my personal mission to move humanity forward.</section>
            <section>I am looking to work in a passionate environment with other industrious minds, so please feel free to reach out.</section>
